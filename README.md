About the plot:(Tentative, because the plot is very lame, it may be changed later)
Buddy Simulator 1984 was acquired by Orange Game Studio, and then they changed many things that should not be changed. Then a game, Buddy Simulator 2077, appeared in 2022.
<br>
This game was originally very popular (because the public believed that this game was the sequel of Buddy Simulator 1984). However, because Orange Game Studio put this game in a super simple system made of c++, and because of the undeserved changes of Orange Game Studio, the popularity of this game fell sharply, leading to the closure of Orange Game Studio.
<br>
When Buddy Simulator 2077 is off the shelf in someone else's Steam and can't be displayed in the library, this game appears in your Steam library, and you get it without spending a penny (you didn't want to play it before, so you didn't buy it)!
<br>
As a programmer, you suddenly became very interested in this game. You are going to restore Buddy Simulator 2077 to its fame!
<br>

# 中文
<br>
一个Buddy Simulator 1984的想象续作。
<br>
先下载看看游戏怎么样再在Issues里跟我提建议！

剧情大概：（暂定，因为这个剧情很扯，所以之后还可能改改）
<br>
Buddy Simulator 1984被Orange Game Studio收购，然后他们胡改了很多很多不该改的东西，然后就在2022年出现了一个游戏：Buddy Simulator 2077。
<br>
这个游戏本来很受欢迎（因为大众都认为这个游戏是Buddy Simulator 1984的续作），但是由于Orange Game Studio将这个游戏放在了一个用c++做的超级简单的系统里，还有Orange Game Studio的不该有的改动使这个游戏人气大跌，导致Orange Game Studio倒闭。
<br>
在Buddy Simulator 2077在其他人的Steam下架并且在库中也没办法显示时，你的Steam库里出现了这款游戏，而且你一分钱没花（你之前本来也不想玩所以没有买）就得到了他！
<br>
而你是一个程序员，这一举动让你对这个游戏突然起了很大的兴趣，你打算要把Buddy Simulator 2077恢复名气！
